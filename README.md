This repository was created for my Tkinter GUI [Medium Tutorial](https://izudada.medium.com/how-to-create-a-to-do-app-with-tkinter-e03bea1dd089)

### Note
Windows users do not need to install Tkinter, as it come preinstalled while istalling python.

If you are running a linux OS you will need to install python2-tk manaully to be able to build uisng tkinter. Refer to this [resource](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-tkinter-linux/)
